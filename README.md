# BU Journalism 550/704 Project Issue Queue

This repository exists to support an issue queue for projects and Wordpress sites created by student
teams in [BU Journalism 550: Advanced Online Journalism](http://bujournalism.com/jo550/) and [BU Journalism 704: Advanced Online Journalism](http://bujournalism.com/j0704).

## About Advanced Online Journalism

Advanced Online Journalism is an advanced online journalism course offered by Boston
University's College of Communications. Part of our mission in this course is
to help you experience tools and ways of working that you will encounter
in the industry as you join teams doing digital-first news projects.

## What's an issue?

During class, you will be assigned into teams that you will work with throughout
the semester. With those teams, you will develop and pitch project ideas that
you will work on with your team. You have the opportunity to work on a variety
of platforms and use a variety of tools. As part of this work -- YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES.

Examples:

  * We're trying to add a map to the Wordpress site we created for our project, but after loading the plugin and the data, the page is blank.
  * We're passing a video file back and forth, but every time we do, one of our team members can't load the file on their laptop to edit it.
  * We're using a timeline plugin -- and now we can't see the front page of our site.

Issues happen when you get stuck. Stuck is something you will encounter all the time
as part of your professional life if you work with or in or around technology. Handling it well --
being able to document it, communicate it, get the help you need, and resolve the problem --
is a critical professional skill.

## How do I file an issue?

You file your issues by visiting our [class repo](https://github.com/lisawilliams/bu550/issues) and clicking on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/lisawilliams/bu550/issues).

Once you [visit the Issues tab](https://github.com/lisawilliams/bu550/issues) for our class repository, you click the button that says
"New Issue" and describe your issue.

### Read before you write your first issue

* Read: [How to file a good issue](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/)
* Search the issue queue. You can get extra credit points by filing great issues. You can also lose points by filing an issue that another team has already filed. Make sure to see if someone else has already filed the same issue.

*In every issue, you should include the following:*

* Your team name
* Your section (550, 704)
* The URL I should be looking at to help you with your problem
* A description of what you were trying to do. Include any plugins, tools or libraries you are using to do this, and links to them.
* The results you expected to get when you were trying to do it.
* The results that actually happened.
* Anything you tried to fix the problem.
* What you Googled, and what you found out from Googling (I won't answer your issue until you can show me you tried to fix it, or find information about how to fix it, on your own).

### ONE ISSUE PER ISSUE

Each issue you file must contain only *one* problem you are trying to fix.

*Good: "When we changed our theme, videos disappeared"*

*Bad: "When we changed our theme, videos disappeared. We also want to pick a new plugin for maps"*

**Never put a list of unrelated problems in an issue.** An issue should tackle only ONE problem you are having.

### Why write an issue? Why not just ask my instructor?

Programmers and other tech folk have a phrase: "Rubber Ducking." Rubber ducking is the process of
working through and solving your own issue by explaining it to...a rubber duck.

When you write a solid issue -- in which you describe exactly what you did, what happened next,
what you tried to fix it, what you Googled, and the current state -- you'll often find that
during that process *you yourself* will figure out what went wrong and be able to fix it. If you do -- publish the issue anyway!

By using Slack and Github, you are also using tools that forward-thinking employers will see as
a valuable part of the skill package you can bring to their organization.

**IMPORTANT**

After you file your issue, paste a link to the URL of your issue in the #issues channel in our class Slack channel. Be sure to @message me (@lisawilliams). If you don't do these things, I won't see your issue and
you won't get help right away.
