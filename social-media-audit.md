# Social Media Audit

Each of you will be performing a social media audit for the news organization you
are following as part of your semester-long News Tracker assignment.

Below is a template to use to guide your investigation of your news organization's
use of social platforms.

This assignment has three components:


## Intro and Analysis

When writing your News Tracker blog post for this assignment, begin
with a brief paragraph summarizing your findings and observations. If you have
questions or advice, include them.

## Data

Copy and paste the Social Media Audit Questions you see below along with the
answers you found.

## Twitter List

Create a Twitter list of social media accounts for the organization you are following
(core account, accounts for events or topics/sections, for individual reporters,
editors, and staff). Follow that list as a column in your Tweetdeck.

As with all News Tracker assignments, tweet out a link and also post a link
in the #newstracker channel of our class's Slack workspace.
